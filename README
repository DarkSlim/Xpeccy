How to compile
- install cmake
- open therminal emulator and make this:
	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake ..
If something going wrong, fix it - install qt4, sdl, alsa and zlib developement files
And...
	make
Result should be './build/xpeccy' executable file

By default there is only ZX Spectrum 48K romset w/o TRDOS.
